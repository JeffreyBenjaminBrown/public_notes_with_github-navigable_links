* Time is a construct more useful at some times than others.
* justification
  Various mystical traditions claim that time is an illusion.
  (I am not.)
* in the physics sense
  alternatives, in order of ocurrence
** Every moment is equally real.
   Though some more likely.
   Only some are you.
** Past and future are one.
** There is only now.
* Is there investment?
  or just karma
  where karma can include 'you got lucky'

* in the mystical sense
** Is it made just through some kind of balance?
** Is it not solved but rather transcended?
