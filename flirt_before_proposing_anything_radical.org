** explication
   Perhaps the reason flirtation works is that it can be reasonably
   mistaken for humor or a simple attempt to become friends,
   because in some cases it is.
** upshots
*** Multiple layers of confirmation might be necessary.
*** Flirt falsely sometimes.
    Like in poker, if you never bluff, you're too easy to read.
* Flirt before proposing anything radical.
