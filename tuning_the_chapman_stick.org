** how
   Tune the stick at the 12th fret
     (orughly an octave below the 3rd harmonic).
   Then test 42\41 frets higher, on the 33rd fret.
   Look at the tuner.
   If that high note is flat,
   the bridge piece needs to come in.
   If it's at the right 41-edo note but a little off,
   moving by half of the big screw's width seems about right.
