** find the mic
Run this
  arecord -l
and it will show something like
  **** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
  card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC3246 Analog [ALC3246 Analog]
    Subdevices: 1/1
    Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
Refer to such devices as "hw:x,y", where x is the card number,
and y the device number.
** record a sample
arecord -f S16_LE -c 1 -d 4 -r 44100 --device="hw:1,0" /tmp/test-mic.wav
-f = dunno
-c = number of channels.
  (My current builtin mic has 2; my current USB mic has 1.)
-d = duration (seconds)
-r = sample rate
* capture a screen video (with vocals)
I'm using SimpleScreenRecorder.
These settings work: ALSA, MP4, MP3.
Be sure to choose the input audio device,
which requires scrolling.
* strip noise from an audio track
In Audacity, use "Effects -> Noise Reduction".
