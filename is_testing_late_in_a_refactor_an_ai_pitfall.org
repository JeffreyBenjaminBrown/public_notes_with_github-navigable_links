#+title: Is testing late in a refactor an AI pitfall?
* Maybe testing during a refactor should be greedy?
  If an original function F needs a corresponding new function F'
  during the refactor, as soon as F' comes into existence,
  if there are tests that use F, perhaps rewrite them to use F'.
* Rebuttal: Might be more work.
  Converting tests before all the new functions exist
  seems like it could be hard.
