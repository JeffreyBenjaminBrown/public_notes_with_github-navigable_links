Optics by Example, by Chris Penner
* RESUME at
p. 57 (in the Ctrl-G sense),
"The universe without lenses"
* lenses don't fail
* TODO `lens` seems better than `to` and `sets`
Can I use it instead of them in Hode?
* Template Haskell, TH, macros
makeLenses generates lenses onoly for fields with leading underscores.
For more control, use makeLensesFor or makeLensesWith.
* reading the type signatures of optics
"If you see Functor f itâ€™s probably a lens."

* virtual fields
are (I guess) isomorphic to fields that actually exist
** example: treating a Celsius value as if it were Farenheit
_celsius :: Something -> Float
celsius :: Lens' Something Float

fahrenheit :: Lens' Something Float
fahrenheit = lens getter setter
  where
    getter = celsiusToFahrenheit . view celsius
    setter temp f = set celsius (fahrenheitToCelsius f) temp
* "polymorphic" (as opposed to "simple") optics

 <t>: structure after action
