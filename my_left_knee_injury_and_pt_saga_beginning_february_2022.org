#+title: my left knee: injury and PT saga, beginning February 2022
* how meniscus injuries work
  per [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/org_personal-most_with-github-navigable_links/blob/master/javier_fernando_diaz_cardenas_osteologo.org][Javier Fernando Diaz Cardenas, oste√≥logo]],
  when I [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/my_left_knee_injury_and_pt_saga_beginning_february_2022.org#2022-04-05-i-saw-dr-javier-fernando-diaz-cardenas][saw him on April 5th]].
** The edges of tears can be ragged, which can cause pain.
   The hairy-looking edges can fold under,
   interfering with proper movement.
** The entire meniscus can have a floppy part that folds under.
* my story
** 2022 04 05-06, my knee worsened
   Tuesday I had PT and used straps, which I enjoyed.
   That afternoon I saw [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/org_personal-most_with-github-navigable_links/blob/master/javier_fernando_diaz_cardenas_osteologo.org][Dr. Javier Fernando Diaz Cardenas]],
   who proclaimed that it was pretty good,
   and I didn't need to do surgery yet --
   should do another month of PT and then return.
   But he performed a test where he spins my foot outward,
   which hurt, and which I *think* kept hurting throughout the day.
   But still it was pretty good after that.
   I remember carrying the weights I had bought at Decatlon
   on my head afterward, walking normally.

   Then Wednesday morning I had PT again.
   He had me do exercises with five pounds strapped to my leg.
   Weeks earlier I had done similar with four pounds and been fine,
   but this time there was one exercise I just couldn't do due to pain,
   and at least one other that hurt.
   Again I don't remember if the knee was terribly bad immediately thereafter,
   but it certainly was soon.

   Ever since I have not been able to walk normally,
   and it hurts even at complete rest in bed,
   so much that sometimes I have to switch position.

*** Mine hurts when my foot is twisted outward, because it's folding under.
*** It's probably an incomplete tear.
    That is, from one edge inward, but not to the other edge.
** 2022 03 15, I started PT with [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/secret_org_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/unifisio_sas_provides_physical_therapy_in_bogota_maybe_more.org][Unifisio SAS]]

   The doctor treats four people at once,
   doesn't ask many questions or spend much time with me.
** 2022 03 09-ish: [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/org_personal-most_with-github-navigable_links/blob/master/sebastian_rodriguez_serna_otropedia_y_traumatologia.org][Dr. Sebastian Rodriguez]] saw the MRI
   He told me to do a month of PT and come back.
** 2022 03 07, I got an MRI
** 2022 03 03, I saw [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/org_personal-most_with-github-navigable_links/blob/master/sebastian_rodriguez_serna_otropedia_y_traumatologia.org][Dr. Sebastian Rodriguez Serna]]
   He thinks I've "lesionado" (torn) my meniscus,
   and sent me for an X-ray.
** 2022 02 27, popped my knee
   Was doing the yoga spinal twist,
   with my left knee flat against the floor.
   It made a loud popping sound, which hurt a lot.
   Now my knee has low-level pain all the time,
   and is stiff -- and no longer pops.
