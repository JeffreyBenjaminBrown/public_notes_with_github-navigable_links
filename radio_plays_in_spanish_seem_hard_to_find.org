#+title: radio plays in Spanish (seem hard to find)
* what an AI said
Ficción Sonora: The modern term used by major networks (like RTVE in Spain) for high-budget, immersive audio dramas.
Radioteatro
Radionovela: Traditionally more "soap opera" style
Podcast de Ficción: The term you'll most often find on Spotify or Apple Podcasts.
* I only found like 8 on Audible.
