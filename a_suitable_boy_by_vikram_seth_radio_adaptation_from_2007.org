#+title: A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth, adaptation by BBC Radio 4
so far these notes are nearly useless
except as a recommendation
* Notes on A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth, radio adaptation from 2007
  by BBC 4 Radio
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/presence.org#be-aware-of-the-troubles-of-everyone-present-simultaneously][Be aware of the troubles of everyone present simultaneously.]]
   The worrying mother resembles Jesus Christ.
** The radio play is oceanic.
   in the way it balances in a sequence
   the set of experiences across people
** I thought it included many statements which takeen completely out of context are astoundingly beautiful.
