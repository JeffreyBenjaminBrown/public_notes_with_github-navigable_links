#+title: hope v. fun : competing hypotheses for motivation
* more definition
  a game that's too hard isn't fun
* Hope and fun blur together via time preference.
** illustration
   It's fun to rollerskate because you hope, and it'll probably be true, that pushing this way will make you go that.
   Maybe conversely, iff you're sufficiently convinced of a far-off hope, pushing for it is fun.
** Complication: It's especially fun to succeed when you didn't expect to.
   Although getting there seems usually not fun.
