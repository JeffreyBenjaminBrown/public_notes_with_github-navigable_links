#+title: osc-gen: Save file or all files in buffer.
* Only hard once there is [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/osc_gen_content_context_switching.org#alt-id][content context switching]].
* motivation
  Would probably greatly boost useability and adoption --
  I would be reluctant to use the product without it,
  and others will be more skeptical than me.
* algorithm
** Before saving, a property should record provenance.
   Provenance = why each content node is on the screen
   = the content context that can claim it.
** Saving each [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/osc_gen_content_context_switching.org#alt-id][content context]] separately.
   serial
*** Dump context into a new buffer.
*** strip other contexts
    This content context might contain others.
    They can be ignored while saving it.
*** strip non-file-conent content
*** strip intermediating "content" relationship hedings
    if there are any.
    Promoting their content up a level
*** Then save normally.
