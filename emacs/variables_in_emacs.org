#+title: variables in Emacs
* define a global variable
** `defvar` : the default
** `defcustom` : define a customizable variable
** `defconst` : define not-really "constants"
   `defconst` informs human readers that you do not intend to change the value of a variable.
   Emacs does not raise an error if you actually change it.
   "The difference between defconst and defvar is mainly a matter of intent".
* set a variable (global or local)

:END:
  (setq x 'value)
** PITFALL: `setq` affects the "current binding".
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
   The current binding is the nearest (not shadowed) one.
   "If a local binding is in effect, using setq on the local variable stores the specified value in the local binding", doing nothing to the global binding.
* Emacs is moving toward lexical scoping from dynamic scoping.
* `let` varieties
** let: : binds all variables without reference to the others
   If one seems to refer to another, it actually refers to whatever value that other will end up shadowing in the "let body".
** let* : any variable can refer to earlier ones
** letrec : ???
* unbind a value with `makunbound`
  tag : delete
** PIFALL: Not a typo.
   It seems like they should have written "makeunbound",
   but they didn't.
* `boundp` : test for boundness
* some name conventions to indicate the type of a variable

* PITFALL: [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/emacs/pitfall_avoid_half_initialized_values_emacs.org][Avoid half-initialized values. \ Emacs]]
* referring to values only defined at runtime
  "Occasionally, you may want to reference a variable which is only determined at run time. In that case, you cannot specify the variable name in the text of the program. You can use the symbol-value function to extract the value."
* computing the symbol (as well as the value) to set at runtime
  `set` rather than `setq`.

* some kinds of variable scopes
  Each easy to find in manual.
  Sometimes these terms are hyphenated, sometimes not,
  inconsistently.

** file local variables
** directory local variables
** connection local variables
* aliases : variables with multiple names
  "make two variables synonyms, so that both variables always have the same value, and changing either one also changes the other."
* There are "variables with restricted values".
* "generalized variables"
  e.g. "the second value in this list"
** `setf (car a) b`
** One can "define new forms that setf can operate on."
