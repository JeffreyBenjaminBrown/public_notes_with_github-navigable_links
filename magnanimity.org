* Aristotle on it
  according to Wikipedia
** "haughty towards men of position and fortune, but courteous towards those of moderate station"
** "open both in love and in hate"
** "not bear a grudge"
   Don't punch up for the sake of punching,
   do it only as it's warranted.
** Too much of it is vanity, but too little is also bad.
