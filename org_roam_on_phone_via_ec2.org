#+title: org-roam on phone via EC2 and Termux
* how I set up Termux
** be sure it has storage access
** copy my data onto my phone
   and from Termux, copy it into native Termux disk space
** pkg install openssh
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/secret_org_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/org_roam_on_phone_via_ec2_private.org#some-scripts][create a connection script]]
* how I set up the EC2 instance
** I used a Debian t3.micro w/ 8 GB storage
   It doesn't give 750 free hours like t2.micro,
   but over a year it's at least 10 dollars cheaper,
   and after that should be 20.
** sudo apt install -y git zip unzip encfs snap sqlite3 gcc tree
** snap install emacs --classic
** add snap installations to PATH
   # append this line to ~/.profile
   PATH=$PATH:/snap/bin
** backup the .ssh/ folder
   cp -r .ssh dot-ssh/
*** PITFALL: Without this, I can't connect to the instance.

** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/secret_org_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/org_roam_on_phone_via_ec2_private.org#copy-into-ec2][copy my data there]]
*** the idea
    All of ~/.ssh (minus the .pem file to connect to EC2).
    All of /home/jeff/ugh/une/org-roam
      PITFALL: Copying individual pieces of it didn't work,
      but copying it as a whole did.
*** the bash command
    zip -r to-ec2.zip              \
      /home/jeff/ugh/une/org-roam/ \
      /home/jeff/ugh/une/text-in-git/code-ish/ssh-dot/
** move that data into place
** copy the backed-up .ssh content back into .ssh
*** cp ~/dot-ssh/* ~/.ssh
    This overwrites some data I copied from my laptop,
    which appears not to matter.
