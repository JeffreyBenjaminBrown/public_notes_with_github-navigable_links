#+title: MIDI keyboard in Linux, how to use
This might only apply to USB-connected MIDI keyboards.
* steps
  serial
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/pianoteq_seems_to_be_getting_low_priority.org][Disable CPU throttling.]]
** Turn on QJackCtl.
** Run `[[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/a2jmidid_and_aconnect.org][a2jmidid]]` from a shell.
   This creates a MIDI Through port.
** Connect the MIDI keyboard via USB.
** Connect the keyboard to the MIDI Through.
*** how to decide whether to do it graphically or via the shell
    [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/midi-keyboard-esp-usb-in-linux-how-to-use.org#if-the-keyboard-shows-up-in-the-qjackctl-signal-graph-it-can-be-connected-that-way-otherwise-connecting-it-requires-aconnect][If the keyboard shows up in the QJackCtl signal graph, it can be connected that way. Otherwise, connecting it requires `aconnect`.]]
*** alternatives
**** via `aconnect` on the command line

:END:
***** Run `aconnect -i` to see available connections.
      Example:

      [jeff@jbb-hp17:~]$ aconnect -i
      client 0: 'System' [type=kernel]
	  0 'Timer           '
	  1 'Announce        '
      client 14: 'Midi Through' [type=kernel]
	  0 'Midi Through Port-0'
      client 20: 'Lumatone' [type=kernel,card=1]
	  0 'Lumatone MIDI 1 '
***** Use `aconnect` to connect the keyboard to the MIDI Through.
      Example (continued):

      aconnect 20:0 14:0
**** via the QJackCtl signal graph
     Just plug the keyboard into the MIDI Through.
** Use the QJackCtl signal graph to connect the a2j MIDI Through to its destination.
   For example, to a DAW.
* PITFALLs
** Each MIDI Through has two halves, the in and the out. Sometimes it can be confusing which you're referring to.
** If the keyboard is not visible* upon plugging in
*** I might need to restart my computer.
    (*) via `aconnect -i` or in the QJackCtl graph.
    This happpened <2025-03-07 Fri>.
*** I might have a bad cable.
** `a2jmidid` might create more than one port. I'm not sure how it knows how many to create.
** If the keyboard shows up in the QJackCtl signal graph, it can be connected that way. Otherwise, connecting it requires `aconnect`.
