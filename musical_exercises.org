#+title: musical exercises
* TODO the "sound good" constraint
  Keep the rhythm, don't do anything so complex that it drags.
  Keep it melodic. Classical-sounding chord changes.
    Only the melody gets extremely microtonal sometimes.
* TODO [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/splash_improv.org][splash improv]]
* TODO break patterns
** slow weird harmony
   Carefully, slowly, pick tones I would never pick.
** fast weird hands
   Quickly, use patterns in my hands that I would never use,
   or that I would never use that quickly,
   even if the notes are "wrong".
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/music_to_emulate.org][music to emulate]]
* TODO sensitivity exercises
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/to_study_the_pitches_of_an_edo.org][to study the pitches (of an edo)]]
** vary the size of a change
   What's a maximal scale change? A minimal velocity change? etc.
* juggle the [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/musical_fundamentals.org][musical fundamentals]]
* TODO memory games \ music
** complexity waves
   lengthen and shorten a motif
** Increase the number of (interpolated, interspersed) voices
** increase number of working elements from the [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/musical_fundamentals.org][musical fundamentals]]
* across the Lumatone
** (number of voices X speed) X hand
   e.g.
     1 fast bass voice + 2 slow high voices
** cover the full horizontal range
** cover the full vertical range
*** with any number of hands
* groove, then radical change
  while groove-meditating, think of something really different
* TODO drift a groove
* rhythm > pitch
* blind
** and two-handed
* across hands
** TODO separation/independence
   Give adequate attention* to both.
   * = complexity of rhythm, harmony, dynamics
       bichords
** TODO call and repeat
** TODO unisons
   esp. with hands spread wide (2 octaves)
** a single (big) chord, (fast) melody
** share a voice between two hands
** TODO cross hands
* pedal tones, inc. high ones
