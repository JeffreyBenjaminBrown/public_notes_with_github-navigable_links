* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/fix_backlinnks_when_merging.org][fix backlinnks when merging]]
* lists and sets
** and maybe a generalization containing both

** why
*** search for them by any member
    Permit searching for any collection,
    rather than | in addition to
    specifally list, set, etc.,
    because you might not remember how
    you saved the collection.
*** recognize overlap, duplication automatically
    Don't permit duplication.
    Report overlap.
* large uniform trees
  Each tree having the same rules -- series like "content, linkers ...", and generalizations thereof.
