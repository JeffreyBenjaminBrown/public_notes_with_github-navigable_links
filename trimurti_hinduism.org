#+title: Trimurti \ Hinduism
notes from reading Wikipedia
* creation, preservation, destruction
  In some space this is an incomplete covering.
* "viewpoints"
** I'm surprised Brahmanism is not listed here.
   At least one other page calls Brahma the Creator.
** Shaivism
*** creation, preservation, dissolution, grace, illusion
    Shiva does each of the first three as different personalities,
    among them the other two gods of the trinity and not himself.
    The (non-Shavists?) associate Shiva only with destruction.
** Vaishnavism
*** Shiva and Brahma are both forms of Vishnu.
** Shaktism
*** A female create-preserve-destroy trio is supreme.
*** "Consorts of the Trimurti"
**** (Brahma : create) ~ (Saraswati : learning, arts, and music)
**** (Vishnu : preserve) ~ (Lakshmi : ?(pleasure & greatness) )
***** where (pleasure & greatness) = all of these
****** *light*, fortune, wealth, fertility, auspiciousness, material fulfillment
****** prosperity, glory, magnificence, joy, exaltation, greatness
****** spiritual fulfillment

***** It's weird to me how much Lakshmi seems to outshine Saraswati.
**** (Shiva : destroyer) ~ (Parvati : power, war, beauty, love)
** Smartism
*** different gods
**** Wikipedia on Trimurti says Smartism added Shakti and Surya, and eventually Kartikeya
**** Wikipedia on Smarta Tradition says Ganesha, Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Surya
