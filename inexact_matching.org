#+title: Inexact Matching Algorithms (bioinformatics)
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/distance_measures_on_the_space_of_sequences.org][Distance Measures On The Space Of Sequences]]
* Hamming-measured inexact matching
= look for matches within a given Hamming radius.
** Modifying the naive matching algorithm for Hamming inexactitude is easy.
Rather than break upon seeing the first mismatch,
count mismatches, break only when they exceed a threshold.
** Divide the pattern into k+1 partitions to match within a radius of k.
If P occurs in T with d or fewer edits,
then at least one of the partitions of P occurs with no edits.
If any of them matches, then the "verification" is just to check the other partitions adjacent. If they match with k or fewer edits, it's a match.
