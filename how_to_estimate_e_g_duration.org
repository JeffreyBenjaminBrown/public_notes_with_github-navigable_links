#+title: how to estimate anticipated duration
* source
  [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/daniel_kahneman.org][Daniel Kahneman]]?
  Or was it someone quoted by Steve Levitt in his podcast interview with DK in 2021?
* the idea
  Estimation (e.g. of duration) is best done via indepedent chunks, rather than a wholistic intuition. (per Daniel Kahneman)
  Then subdivide a different way and estimate again.
