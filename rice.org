#+title: rice
* TODO try less water and time
  don't overcook
* 3 cups rice, works well.
  17.2g salt (= 15 ml lately)
  3 big white cups rice.
  4 big white cups water.
  9 minutes to boil.
  Boil on lowest for 96 minutes.
* proportions
  PITFALL: water scales nonlinearly with rice!
** <2026-01-04 Sun> trying 8.6 g salt = 10 ml for this new salt
   on 2 big white cups of rice
** <2025-07-10 Thu> seemd good: 10 ml salt
   on 2 big white cups of rice
** <2025-07-05 Sat> trying 1/2 tbsp* of salt
   (*) literally, via that-sized measuring spoon
** 1 cup brown rice, 2 cups water
** 2 cup brown rice, 3 cups water, biggest meas. spoon of salt
   I think that's a tablespoon.
* took about 1:02* for steam to stop spouting from rice
  * That's 1:02 after boiling & reducing to min heat.
  That was 1 of the curvey cups birds-and-leaves cups,
  which is about 1.25 actual cups.
