Some of this only applies to the Dell Inspiron (2017, i5)
that I did it to (January 2020).
** PITFALL: 2 slots of different sizes?
*** in short
It seems to be:
The output from dmidecode shows the size of the installed RAM correctly.
But if a slot is empty, it shows it as DIMM when in fact it should be SODIMM.
To know for sure one ought to look at the motherboard schematics.
But I just gambled that they'd both be the same, SODIMM (the laptop size),
so I bought that, and it worked.
*** asked Reddit
are there two slots of different size, onne SODIMM and one DIMM?
