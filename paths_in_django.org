* PITFALL: `reverse` and `urlpatterns` work together
** sample code
   from   django.urls import reverse
   HttpResponseRedirect (
      reverse ( # This constructs the URL
        "run_make:thank-for-spec",
        kwargs = {
          "user_email" : user_email,
          "subsample"  : subsample,
      } )
   )
** It only works if there's a corresponding entry in urls.py
   For instance, this would let it work:

   urlpatterns = [
     path( 'thank-for-spec/<subsample>/<user_email>',
       views.thank_for_spec,
       name='thank-for-spec'),
     ... ]
** The resulting URL has none of the keywords.
   But I'm guessing it worries about whether they appear in urls.py.
** Happily, order of the dictionary seems not to matter.

  return render ( request,
                  "run_make/thank_for_spec.html",
                  { "subsample" : subsample,
                    "user_email" :  user_email,
                   } )
