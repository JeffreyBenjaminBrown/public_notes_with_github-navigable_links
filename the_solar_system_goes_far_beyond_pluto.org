#+title: The solar system extends far beyond Pluto.
* Pluto is 40 [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/au.org][AU]]s from us.
* The Oort cloud is 50,000 AUs from us.
* The comets in it, while "held" by the Sun, are held so weakly that they move at only around 220 miles per hour.
