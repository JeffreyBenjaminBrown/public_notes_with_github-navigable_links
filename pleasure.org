* Pleasure is subjective.
  e.g. not everyone enjoys roller coasters
* Tastes can be acquired.
  e.g. alcohol
* Enjoyment and desire are only loosely coupled.
  We want some things that are not pleasurable,
    (wait, what did I have in mind?)
  and we enjoy some things that we do not want, or
                           that we do not want to enjoy.
* Pleasure's object need not be real.
  "aesthetic or disinterested pleasure"
  "A pleasure is disinterested if it is indifferent to the existence of the beautiful object ... For example, the joy of looking at a beautiful landscape would still be valuable if it turned out that this experience was an illusion"

* the "peak–end rule"
** definition
   "[O]ur overall impression of past events is determined for the most part not by the total pleasure and suffering it contained but by how it felt at its peaks and at its end."

** Its application to colonoscopies is funny.

** anhedonia: being unable to feel it

* Many have defined it only as the absence of suffering.
  e.g. Schopenhauer, who considered suffering the default or baseline.

  "A study found that procrastinators were less future-oriented than their non-procrastinator counterparts. This result was hypothesized to be in association with hedonistic perspectives on the present; instead it was found procrastination was better predicted by a fatalistic and hopeless attitude towards life.[33]"
