** There is pleasure in both laughter and in seriousness.
** There is pleasure in both energy   and in lethargy.
* its plasticity
** Pleasure is subjective.
   e.g. not everyone enjoys roller coasters
** Tastes can be acquired.
   e.g. alcohol
*** Not necessarily a worthwhile pursuite.
** Enjoyment and desire are only loosely coupled.
   We want some things that are not pleasurable,
     (wait, what did I have in mind?)
   and we enjoy some things that we do not want, or
                            that we do not want to enjoy.
** Pleasure's object need not be real.
   "aesthetic or disinterested pleasure"
   "A pleasure is disinterested if it is indifferent to the existence of the beautiful object ... For example, the joy of looking at a beautiful landscape would still be valuable if it turned out that this experience was an illusion"

This result was hypothesized to be in association with hedonistic perspectives on the present; instead it was found procrastination was better predicted by a fatalistic and hopeless attitude towards life.[33]"
