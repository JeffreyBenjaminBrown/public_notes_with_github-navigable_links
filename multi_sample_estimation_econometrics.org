** DONE some people|places I asked about it
*** I'm emailing [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/org_personal-most_with-github-navigable_links/blob/master/robert_mcclelland.org][Robert McClelland]] at TPC about it.
 They use old data (2011), on the theory that the US was closest to its steady state at that time. They update it according to aggregate GDP changes.
*** I asked JW and GS
*** I asked on Cross-Validated

** had a useful literature section on multi-sample estimation

* two-sample istrumental variables (2SIV)
** two-sample two-stage least squares (2S2SLS)
Whereas IV = 2SLS, 2SIV /= 2S2SLS.
