#+title: a format friendlier for reading diffs than org-roam's
* the idea
** Each file is a flat org-file.
   Flat = only level-1 headlines.
** Headlines can be
   alternatives
*** plain text
*** links to another file F "in" the host file H

:END:
    Such a file F extends the view from H,
    and is not necessarily meaningful outside of the context of F.
    If a yet further nested file G is a child of F,
    I that file too should be considered to be "in" H, not F.
*** links to another stand-alone file.
** The view from standalone file F

   transcludes through all of the files "in" it.
* Downside: This makes the org files hard to read without special software.
  It's not rocket science, but it's tedious:
  [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/a_format_friendlier_for_reading_diffs_than_org_roam_s.org#the-view-from-standalone-file-f][The view from standalone file F]] can require traversing more files than F itself.
* Motivation: Why this makes diffs easy to read.
  Each move is just a single insertion-deletion pair,
  consisting of just two lines in the diff.
* Question: What's a good term for [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/a_format_friendlier_for_reading_diffs_than_org_roam_s.org#links-to-another-file-f-in-the-host-file-h][files "within" files]]?
