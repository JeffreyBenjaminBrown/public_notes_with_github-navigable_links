#+title: xmonad (window manager)
* DONE internalized
** Xmonad is lightweight.
** Xmonad can work with KDE.
* PITFALL: [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/xfce_desktop_environment.org#kill-top-and-bottom-application-bars-in-xfce-the-panel][kill top *and* bottom application bars in xfce ("the panel")]]
  For me they were essentially incompatible with xmonad,
  because they float on top,
  yet every window is maximized.
  In particular this hides the tabs in a web browser.
  (It also causes Alt-Tab (which I changed it to Super-Tab)
  to cycle through two or three additional useless spaces.)
* PITFALL | DEALBREAKER: screen zoom not available

** It, and  Xfce's Window Manager Tweaks, both work outside of xmonad.
** I suspect Xmonad has no [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/screen_zoom_computer_interface_concept.org#on-linux-screen-zoom-usually-requires-a-compositor][compositor]] by default.

*** In response I enabled picom; still couldn't use Tweaks or Zoom.
    services.picom = {
      # Hopefully lets me use screen zoom in Xmonad.

      enable = true;
      # activeOpacity = 1.0;
      # inactiveOpacity = 0.8;
      backend = "glx"; # I also tried the default, "xrender".
      # fade = true;
      # fadeDelta = 5;
      # # opacityRule = [ "100:name *= 'i3lock'" ];
      # shadow = true;
      # shadowOpacity = 0.75;
    };
** I suspect the problem is that it needs xfwm, which means no xmonad.
