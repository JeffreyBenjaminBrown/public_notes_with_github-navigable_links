#+title: detachment
* TODO read St. Ignatius of Loyola on it
** Claude on St. Ignatius on it
*** implications
**** Money, health, reputation, relationships - hold them lightly
**** Be equally ready to accept or give up anything if it serves the greater good
*** The goal is freedom to love and serve, not emotional numbness.
*** The paradox: True detachment actually allows for deeper, more authentic engagement
    because you're choosing from love rather than need or compulsion.
* => emotional robustness to setbacks
