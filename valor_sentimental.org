#+title: Valor Sentimental (movie)
* spoiler-free description
Based on what critics and audiences are saying about Sentimental Value (2025):
The Feel:

Rich, sophisticated, with shadows of childhood tragedy and adult missteps falling across the drama Rotten Tomatoes
Intimate and subdued — builds subtle emotional momentum rather than melodrama [Roger Ebert]
Sets out to make you feel things with seeming effortlessness, never signposting big moments Rotten Tomatoes
Bergman-esque in its restraint and emotional depth
Intimate act birthed from both stage (Ibsen and Chekhov) and screen (Bergman and Woody Allen) [Rotten Tomatoes]
Tender, wry, and quietly devastating
Some find it emotionally moving in a sneaky way; others feel it leaves them somewhat cold or waiting for it to fully land

Ideas Engaged:

The uneasy tension between artistic expression and personal connection [Rotten Tomatoes]
Meditation on the sentimental value of art itself [Rotten Tomatoes]
The fault lines that course between vanity, art, and life [MUBI]
Generational trauma — how historical trauma (WWII torture, suicide) echoes through family lines
The reconciliatory power of art — whether making art from family trauma heals or exploits
Parental absence and abandonment — the specific pain fathers inflict by prioritizing work over presence
Memory and home — the house as a living character, repository of both joy and pain
Performance and identity — especially Bergman-like themes around how we perform ourselves
The cost of artistic ambition — what artists sacrifice for their work and whether it's worth it

The film is widely praised for its authenticity in portraying strained family dynamics, avoiding melodrama by showing that fraught relationships aren't defined solely by their conflicts. It's considered a mature, layered work that lingers in the mind.
