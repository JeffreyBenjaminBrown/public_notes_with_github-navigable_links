#+title: I Hate To Whine
even when writing to myself.
* Because whining makes for depressing reading.
* And that doesn't makes sense.
Just like reporters report on bad things because it's important, writing seems most likely to be useful if it's in large part about problems.
* The root problem isn't about writing.
At root, it's about processing hard problems.
