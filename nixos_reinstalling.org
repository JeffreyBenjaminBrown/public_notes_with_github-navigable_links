#+title: NixOS, installing
* CONTEXT
  This regards installing from scratch, not upgrading.
  Learned during the install process for NixOS 20.09.
  Before I had it working I asked some questions here:
  https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-20-09-fresh-vanilla-install-this-gpt-partition-label-contains-no-bios-boot-partition/9903/6
* TODO every time
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/kde_lets_you_export_a_shortcut_scheme.org][KDE lets you export a shortcut scheme!]]
** update system-minimal and system-<target> in nix/jbb
   before copying it to the new system
** save data, and shuttle some of it to the new system during installation
   Brave passwords

* PITFALLs
** My `~/ugh/une/code-ish/` might be confusing
   There are symlinks into that from, at least, these places:
     ~/.ssh
     ~/.aws
     ~/code/web/aws/secret
   I *think* restoring from Borg will handle those cases correctly,
   but have not tested it.
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/uefi.org#to-check-whether-a-computer-uses-uefi][check whether the computer uses UEFI]]
   If not, install with Legacy Boot.
   (So far all my computers use Legacy.)
** UEFI is described before Legacy Boot.
   Legacy Boot is what I want,
   at least for my 2017 Dell, my 2018 Javeriana Lenovo, and earlier machines.
** TODO prepare data on old system
*** see nix/jbb/bash/dot-files*
    but that's missing some!
    e.g. below
*** some dot files will not be part of my backup
    For instance, my ~/.stack/config.yaml file, because .stack/ is excluded from my backups.
[[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/nixos_my_config.org#pitfall-my-config-outside-of-nix-files][PITFALL: my config outside of .nix files]]
*** export Brave passwords
    I won't be able to reover them from my old data without doing this.
    Remember also to delete the file after.
** eventually, don't use `hardware.pulseaudio.enable = true;`
   It's good for a simple sound setup,
   but the complex options I use for live-coding are not compatible with it.
** use GRUB and grub.device="/dev/sda"
   UEFI is preferred but my 2017 Dell didn't like it (November 2020).
   Maybe I overwrote UEFI with GRUB earlier.
** after installing and rebooting, sign in as root
   That's the password I set during installation.
   Once in, run `passwd jeff`.
   After that, I can login as a normal user.
** do NOT replace home with what I saved
   That will delete, among maybe other hidden files,
   the .lcoal folder, which breaks the system.
** download Docker images early
   because it takes a long time
** Brave bookmarks can be transferred ex-post
   e.g. from this file:
     ~/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Default/Bookmarks
   PITFALL: After that, bookmarks still won't be visible,
      until I ask for them to be.
** configure git to use diff-so-fancy
   git config --global core.pager "diff-so-fancy | less --tabs=4 -RFX"

* handy commands while installing, roughly ordered
** wifi password
** check if the machine uses UEFI
   ls /sys/firmware/efi
   If that's present, it uses UEFI.
** install some things
   nix-env -iA nixos.emacs
   nix-env -iA nixos.gnome.gnome-disk-utility
   nix-env -iA nixos.tmux
** git config
   git config --global user.email "jeffbrown.the@gmail.com"
   git config --global user.name "JeffreyBenjaminBrown"
** cp config
   sudo cp ~/install/configs/configuration.7.weird-details /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
   sudo cp ~/install/configs/packages.9.audio.transfer-complete /etc/nixos/packages.nix
   sudo cp ~/install/configs/emacs.nix /etc/nixos/
** sudo nixos-rebuild switch
** passwd jeff
   Do this as root when I first log in.
   Thereafter I can log in as jeff.

* installing without X
** drop the screen resolution if possible
   Unfortunately `xrandr` is not part of the installer.
** connect to the network

   I was unable, and gave up here.
