  For each, consider the other's available responses.

** Cam's challenge
*** in 46-edo, play 0-17-32
    because it's pretty harmonic (both are flat)
    and it has the biggest possible vertical range on the Lumatone
    (in my 4x7 tuning).
* dubious
** When there's a surprise minor third, I like it not in the bass.
* u
** I want to be able to play more stepwise root movements.
