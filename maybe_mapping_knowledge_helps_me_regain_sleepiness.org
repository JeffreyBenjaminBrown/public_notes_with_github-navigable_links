#+title: Maybe mapping knowledge helps me regain sleepiness.
After only spending half an hour [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/knowledge_organizing_everyone_s.org][mindmapping]] circa <2023-09-06 Wed>,
I wanted to go back to bed.
On the other hand, I didn't fall to sleep at all quickly thereafter.
