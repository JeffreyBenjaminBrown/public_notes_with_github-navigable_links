#+title: sleep rules
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/calming_music_helps_me_prepare_to_sleep.org][Calming music helps me prepare to sleep.]]
* end the day calm
** It's smart to end the day socially.
   Ending it with any kind of work -- personal coding, even music -- makes my mind hyper and reluctant to sleep.
** Music, exercise, work -- late, they're all bad.
* caffeine won't let me sleep (deeply) for 15 hours
  at least if I take a 90 minute nap
* eat immediately in morning
* get up once the sun's up and my last sleep cycle was short
* sleep no more than 9 hours in the day
* do not start a nap after 4 pm
* Matcha keeps me from sleeping.

  Even a tiny amount, a teaspoon,
  seems to stick in my system forever.
  The last time it imposed at least a 3 hour delay.
