#+title: A likely upper bound on global injustice.
On the bright side,
even if the selfish powerful who consider themselves geniuses
cannot be dislodged,
they probably (based on who I've met, anyway)
mostly do not want to cause harm --
  just to be inordinately special.
To the extent that they can relax control of business,
even while retaining control of violence
  and taxation under say 50%,
people can with enough technological development
  eventually expect something like a middle-class lifestyle.

True, eventual justice, maybe after one has died,
is not the warmest comfort --
but it was nearly inevitable
that we would have less than we could have had.

I don't mean to justify the quietist impulse.
It's good to try for something better.
This is just an emotional floor.
