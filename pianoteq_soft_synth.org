#+title: Pianoteq (soft synth)
* TODO IF : I need more Pianoteq code
  it's in ~/borg-excluded/
* PITFALL: Pitch bend won't work microtonally.
  The pitch bend message must belong to the same channel
  as the notes it is to bend:

  (This could actually be cool sometimes,
  if I had a way to control that channel.)

* installing Pianoteq
** extract the .7z archive with "7z x <filename>"
   (not "7z e" like I expected).
** I'm using the LV2i format
   Can't remember why I didn't choose VST.
* Solved problems
