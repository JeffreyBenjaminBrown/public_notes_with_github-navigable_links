#+title: identifying and responding to communication styles
* identifying and responding to communication styles
** notes on a video about it
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikbcrpowlIs
*** classic psych dichotomies
**** Do I recognize introversion v. extroversion in people?
**** Do I recognize intellectual v. emotional in people?
**** Do I recognize deliberative v. immediate people?
*** the 4 partitions from the video
**** peaceful ('green')
     insecure, afraid of change
**** fun ('yellow')
**** logical ('blue')
**** power ('red')
     results-oriented, impatient, inflexible
*** handling those 4 partitions
**** red
     be confident, focused, brief
**** green
     be calm, patient, supportive
**** blue
     be thorough and accurate
*** Most people communicate as if others are like them.
