#+title: 62-edo
* harmonic theory
** 62-edo is a great flat system.
   Every harmonic from 2 through 31 is between .8c sharp and 9.4c flat.
** 62-edo beats 31-edo even restricting attention to the 13-limit.
   That's because its 13/8 is flat instead of sharp,
   both slightly closer to true and playing much better with the others.
* layouts
** good for guitar

**** *Seems* to dominate [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/7r_62_x_6d_62_isomorphic_pitch_layout.org][7\62r x 6\62d (isomorphic pitch layout)]]
     but I'm not sure -- arguably the 5-limit is easier in this one.
