#+title: accidental change of focused window in Reaper
* TODO [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/can_the_focused_window_always_be_on_top_reaper.org][Can the focused window always be on top? \ Reaper]]
* the problem
  Sometimes focus switches to the arrange (main) view,
  but the MIDI editor stays in front of it.
* how to detect where the focus is
  alternatives
** cursor movement
   If in the MIDI editor,
   pressing left or right moves the cursor by a few pixels,
   rather than a grid unit,
   it's probably [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/that_left_right_behave_differently_in_arrange_view_and_edit_view_is_arguably_a_feature_not_a_bug_reaper.org][because focus is on the arrange view]].
** shade of title bar
   It's brighter when it's *not* in focus.
* how to switch focus
** good way
   alternatives
*** Alt-Tab
*** clicking the title bar
** bad way
   Clicking inside the window works too,
   but has the side effect of moving the cursor in time.
