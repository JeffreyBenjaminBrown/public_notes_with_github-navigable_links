#+title: AWS S3
= Amazon Simple Storage Service = S3 = buckets
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/secret_org_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/aws_s3_cli.org][S3 has a CLI]]
* PITFALL: Reusing (bucket) names is dangerous.
  I made a public bucket.
  Then I deleted it and made a, supposedly,
  private one with the same name.
  It was still public.
  Then I made a new bucket with a distinct name,
  and made it private.
  It really was private.
* data can be "queried in place"
* data can be "selectively retrieved"
  with "S3 Select"
* buckets and URLs
** bucket <=> URL
   Each (sub)domain needs its own bucket,
   of the same name.
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/secret_org_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/aws_s3_cli.org#website-give-a-bucket-a-public-url][how to give a bucket a public URL]]
* buckets can do versioning
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/enable-versioning.html
* security on S3
** Problem: Anyone with the right URL can view the data.
   If someone else has the URL I see when I visit a file on S3,
   they too can see it.
   That's because the URL has the security token inside it.
** TODO ? Solution: Use an on-disk credential.
   .ssh, for instance.
* use tags to track the cost of a bucket
  thttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev//CostAllocTagging.html
* S3 "Access Points"
  Have URLs.
  Are to control who can access what.
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/aws_static_website_hosting.org][AWS static website hosting]] uses S3 (and Route53)
