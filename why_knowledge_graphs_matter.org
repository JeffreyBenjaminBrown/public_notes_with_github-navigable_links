** You should think in writing. And you should merge your writing with others's.

* Org etc. are a futuristic, artistic way to organize thought.
** The artistic part is the freedom one enjoys/confronts when choosing the categories and other structure of a tree.

* Knowledge graphs are attention-efficient.
* Your writing knows things you don't.
  Just like anything,
  you lose ideas after enough time, unless revising them.
* Users can control their own views.
** duh
*** against The Feed Algorithm
    Rather than only seeing their opaque algorithmic,
    often destructive, and usually at least somewhat dumb "feed".
* Users can search better.
  They needn't but can learn a search language.
* Users can curate their view of each Platonic topic.
  I believe we should journal and meditate.
  Knowledge mapping is similar to them, and permits accretion.

* Users can query to judge sources.
** The viewer can see what they themselves, or others, have marked as false among a writer's earlier posts, and the evidence for or against.
* science, how distributed knowledge graphs could help
** These smell much like the benefits of [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/preregistration.org][preregistration]].
** some reasons
*** Quicker publishing (like Twitter or ArXiV)
*** solves the problem of [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/losing_negative_results_scientific_publishing_problem.org][losing negative results (scientific publishing problem)]]
*** don't duplicate effort
    In particular, if crawling bots recognize statement equivalence, this would permit a fact-checker to simultaneously debunk myriad voicings of a false claim. All of them, if the crawling were sufficiently extensive and the equivalence recognition sufficiently robust.
*** lets you see what kinds of research have proven too hard to finish.
* hypothetical
** Cut through spam.
   Crowdsource the identification of bots and (human-powered)
   content farms.
   By contrast, if a single provider controls all data and traffic,
   there is an incentive to let them exist,
   or at least fight them less than is socially optimal.
