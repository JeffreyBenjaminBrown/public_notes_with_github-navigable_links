* tricks
** use green tea when fasting
   Contains polyphenols, which may promote autophagy.
** electrolytes
   Salt is easiest, others are better.
   Make sure it has no calories.
** viamins
   Try to find them without calories or minerals.
** use amino acids if working out
   They are as calorie-dense (i.e. by weight) as glucose,
   but dosages are small.
