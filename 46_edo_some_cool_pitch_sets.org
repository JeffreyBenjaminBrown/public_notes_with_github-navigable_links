* I like 2-limping scales.
  I like scales with alternating step sizes.

* limping 3-then-9 diminished scales
  alternatives
** start with 3\46
   so 0 3 12 15 24 27 36 39
   The last note is then 39 = 9:5 = the wide m7.
   This includes one perfect fifth
   (aligned with the root),
   tons of 5:4 and 6:5,
   and a few 11:8.
** start with 9\46
   so 0 9 12 21 24 33 36 ?45
   Rather than that last 45\46, substuting 41\46
   (the pitch halfway from 36 to 46) sounds good.
* 10:9 chains up or down from root and fifth
  => neutral scales
* 11-lim dorian #4
  0 6 12 21 27 33 39
** modes
*** code to show modes
    myPrint $ [mode 46 [0,6,12,21,27,33,39] i | i <- [0..6]]
*** the modes

    [0,6,13,19,25,34,40]
    [0,7,13,19,28,34,40]
** noteworthy
   No mode has a tritone [22-24].
   Each scale with 27 (3:2) also has 21 (11:8).
* TODO 9-tone
* septimal augmented: limping 10s and 7s
**** universe
***** two varieties, each of which has two fifths
***** there are surely other varieties of septimal augmented
      but maybe not with two fifths
** 10s then 7, which has an outer 44

** 7s then 10s, which has an outer 41

  not really a fourth (19) but it sounds like it when arpeggiated

* 8 tone neutral scale with fourth and fifth
  has lots of fifths!
  stack of 5-then-9 with a correction from 26 to 27
* 6 tone aug scale with two fourths
  It feels like there are a lot of these but here's (a particularly harmonic?) one:
  0 10 15 27 32 42
* 5-tone 2-limping scale with a 15:8 and three 11:8s
  0 14 21 35 42
* two stacks of fifths, one with one slightly flat 3:2
  Every interval except the one divided by the '+' below
  is 3:2, except the one marked with a caret.

  0 27 8' 35' + 15 41 22
                  ^
                 680c
* [0,5,12 \ 46] x [0,22 \ 46] + 44
  That is, two units of 0-5-12, almost a tritone apart.
  Since there's a little less than a tritone between them,
  there's room to begin (include the first note of) a third cycle,
  so the full scale is
  0 5 12 22 27 34 44
* neutral diminished with lots of perfect fifths
  The first three columns of this two-row table
  are all perfect fifths,
  every interval except at the + is 5\46,
  and there are two modes with [0,10,15,27],

  0   5 10 15 20 +
