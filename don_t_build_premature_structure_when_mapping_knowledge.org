#+title: Don't build premature structure when mapping knowledge.
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/smsn.org][SmSn]] doesn't really need this precaution
  because there's no file|atom distinction.
* the idea
  Wait until a note has a substantial amount of stuff
  before subdividing it.
  Otherwise the data becomes hard to navigate,
  and it's likely that the categories I impose before needing them
  will turn out not to be optimal once the data reaches that size.
