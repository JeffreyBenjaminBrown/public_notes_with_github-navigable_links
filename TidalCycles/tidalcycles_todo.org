#+title: TidalCycles / TODO
* TODO [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/TidalCycles/hypotheses_about_what_sounds_good.org][what sounds good in TidalCycles]]
* TODO [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/TidalCycles/questions_about_the_tidalcycles_language.org][questions about the TidalCycles language]]
* TODO solve
** chords, scales, melodies
** Other ways to achieve whatever leads me to repeat certain coding patterns
*** Like always adding a slow speed change to a repeated hat
** Parameters for sample (not synth)-based patterns
*** Swell?
** "sidechain"
   Where the kick or the snare silences other stuff.
* TODO Record solved puzzles
** Patterns that don't sound good, and simple solutions to it.
* TODO extract my changes in git
  git log jbb --author="Jeffrey Benjamin Brown" -p
  Keep them in a way that won't conflict with anyone else's edits.
* TODO [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/TidalCycles/concepts-for-Tidal-some-high-level-musical.org][concepts for Tidal, some high-level musical]]
* TODO polymeters in Tidal
  https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/thinking-time-in-addition-vs-division-meshuggah-style-prog-metal-in-tidal/4664/6
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/make_bass_drum_key_rhythms.org][make bass-drum-key rhythms]]
* TODO permit line continuations within strings
  This would be an Emacs fix,
  not a Haskell fix.
** some code that might be close
(defun send-highlighted-region-to-receiving-ghci-buffer (beg end)
  (interactive "r")
  (process-send-string receiving-ghci-buffer ":{\n")
  ;; (replace-regexp-in-string "a" "b" "ab")
  ;; (setq message (buffer-substring beg end))
  ( process-send-string receiving-ghci-buffer
		       ( replace-regexp-in-string
			 "\\\n" "" (buffer-substring beg end ) ) )
  (process-send-string receiving-ghci-buffer "\n:}\n"))
(global-set-key ( kbd "C-c s")
		( lambda () (interactive)
		  (send-highlighted-region-to-receiving-ghci-buffer) ) )
* TODO the scale stuff is buggy
  This should result in a monotonic sequence,
  but does not:

  > map (lke' 12 [0,1]) [-5..5]
  [-35.0,-36.0,-23.0,-24.0,-11.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,13.0,24.0,25.0]
** TODO share the scale stuff
   ~/code/music/Tidal/tidal+epic/demo/scales.hs
* TODO open questions, probably
** It's so fun sometimes, and so dumb sometimes
** I should try 12 tones
** The information gets too messy
*** Entangled, can't separate things, make things depend on other things without a lot of evaluation in different places in the document
*** Sprawling
** I get locked into tiny variations of a pattern that I ought to make bigger, more destructive changes to
** My rhythm sucks
* TODO [[:id:25d56fbf-4695-4188-bdef-61d98cc4876a][questions about the language -- broken link?]]
* TODO cover songs
** Communication, by Melt Yourself Down
** Saviour
** Harder better faster
** Happy
** Flat beat
** Sexy and I know it
** Gnossienne no. 1
** Dirty dishes, moon hooch
** Das Techno, Phace
** Rockyou feel it, two fingers

** Mandarine Girl, by Booka Shade
   has at least some cool changes, if not to cover all of
* TODO easy
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/TidalCycles/wrandcat_probabilities_should_precede_their_associated_patterns.org][wrandcat probabilities should precede their associated patterns.]]
** warp (swing, etc.)
*** Define an invertible map g from straight time to warped
*** To query an arc, query the g-preimage of its endpoints, then apply g to all resulting events
** unit-interval Rational patterns
   No new definitions needed --
     fmap (/ 10) "0 2 5 10 15"
   The result can then be multiplied by the number of scale degrees,
   even as the scale varies.
   Then quantized to an integer.
   Then harmony rules applied, ala adjustVoices and avoidDiffsMod.
** There's room for more operators in the mini syntax.
   Just use two characters.
** make variations on `hitspan`
   using other parameters.
   `histpan` is a transition function that pans repetitions of a pattern.
* DONE or stale
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/outline_mode_haskell.org][outline-mode]] & Haskell : I got it working!
