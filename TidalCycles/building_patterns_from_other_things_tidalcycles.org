#+title: building patterns from (usually) other things \ TidalCycles
* numeric patterns
** `run n` gives n events, from 0 to n-1
   d1 $ s "[[bd sn]/2, arpy*2%3]*8" |*| speed (run 8 + 1/2)
** BROKEN: [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/TidalCycles/scan_a_series_of_run_s_first_of_length_1.org][scan = a series of `run`s, first of length 1]]
* patterns from lists
** fromList :: [a] -> Pattern a, appending "slowly"
 That is, appending one event from thelist per cycle.

   d1 $ s "sn:1*2" |*| speed (fromList [1,2,3])

   That is, such that the result is a single cycle.
