#+title: voices, long samples and signal flow in Tidal
* `cps` is a parameter, like `s` or `n` except global.
  Try it with oscillators (e.g. `saw` below).
  p "cpsfun" $ s "bd sd(3,8)" # cps (slow 8 $ 0.5 + saw)
* voice names
** There are some "preassigned voices".
   `d1`, for instance.
   See BootTidal.hs for their definitions.
*** PITFALL: [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/preassigned_voices_also_have_voice_names.org][Preassigned voices also have voice names.]]
** Voice names can be dynamic and informative.
   Rather than use the preassigned voice names like `d1`,
   one can name patterns as in
     p 1
   or
     p "juliet"

* mute, solo, umute, unsolo
  `mute 1` mutes `d1` (which is a synonym for `p 1`).
  `solo` is similar.
