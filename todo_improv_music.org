* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/improv_on_who_or_what_leads.org][Improv on who leads.]]
* alternate two simple motifs in unlike domains
** One could be as simple as three ascending pitches, and the other a simple rhythm.

* vary the bass: no roots or fifths
  Try simply moving the pedal to another note in the scale,
  and play some interval that isn't a fifth.
* vary the chord over a fixed bass
* fix a (bass or both hands) rhythm
* parameters to remember to vary
** # of voices | density (inc. silence)
   try waves in this
** rhythm & dynamics
*** ~1 Hz dynamics figures
    a tiny rhythm to nest into bigger ones
*** uneven chord progression rhythms
** duration : note, theme
   in notes, duration is independent of rhythm
** complexity : pitch set, rhythm, theme
** register
** hand independence
*** unison, parallel, timeshared voice, echo
** big & small changes
