#+title: grep for within-line disjunction
* seems easy now
** the trick: escape the bar
   use \|
   as in "x\|y"
** example : [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/strip_all_pyc_tag_and_files_from_tree_output.org][tree-grep for Python code]]
   Strips all .pyc, TAG and __.*__ files from `tree` output.
* earlier stuff I wrote
** tricks, necessary and maybe otherwise
*** necessary : grep -E
*** dubious : single-quotes around the regex
**** details
     so that the | is not interpreted as a pipe.
     Someone suggested that somewhere,
     but in my test it appears not to be true --
     I can put double-quotes aroudn it and it works perfectly.
**** a test for whether it is necessary
***** make a file containing this
      a
      b
***** grep for this
      grep -E "a|b" -r .
** example
   grep -r . -E 'saveStage|to_csv'
