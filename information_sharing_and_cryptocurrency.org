#+title: information sharing and cryptocurrency
These ideas are still vague,
and I don't know whether they are relevant to Hode.
* cryptocurrency Darwinism
  Belong to multiple communities, each with their own currency, and you can exchange one for the other. In this way communities can gobble each other, in a way that enables algorithms that people enjoy more to dominate.
* resource catalog
  The physical-ish resources available for contribution are computation, memory, data transfer (to and from their own systems) and maybe money. Owning a share of the network means owning exactly those. Maybe there should be multiple currencies for each network, e.g. a memory one, a computation one, etc.
