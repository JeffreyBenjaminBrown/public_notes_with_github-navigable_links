** Alt-drag will stretch a selection of midi notes.
   Drag one side. The other side of the selection stays fixed.
   Any notes whose start and endpoints are both strictly inside
   the selection's boundaries will have both endpoints moved.

* Use ReaPitch to make harmonies.
* Use ReaTune to make pitch corrections.
* Use "stretch markers" to stretch selected items in sync.
* Use ReaTune to tune an instrument.
  It lets you input a Hz value,
  so its fixed assumption of 12-edo can be overridden.
* Use ReaVoice to control an audio clip's pitch via MIDI
