** quote from manual (v. 6.70)
   Select the track(s) then right click over the record arm button for any track in the selection and
   choose Automatic record arm when track selected. This command can be toggled on and off.
   To set all tracks to auto arm, choose the Track command from the main menu, then Set all tracks to
   automatic record arm when selected.
** can be per-track or for all tracks

* punch recording (punch in, punch out)
** what it is
   Set the time when recording will start,
   and another when it will stop.
   Start playback from before the start marker.
   Recording (but not playback) stops at the end marker.
** By default it is non-destructive.
   But destructive is another kind available in (top-level) Options.
** the simplest way to use it
   serial
*** Select that mode from the (top-level) Options.
    It's called "Record mode: time selection auto punch".
*** Disable some things
**** Disable :: "Toggle Repeat" in the transport bar.
**** Disable :: Options / Show all takes (when room) [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/reaper/reaper_shortcuts_and_context_menus.org#show-all-takes-in-a-track-when-there-is-room--c-l][(can use C-l)]]
**** Disable :: Options / Loop points linked to time selection
*** Select a region.
    Do this by clicking on in the track itself.
    There doesn't need to be a clip there already.
    Clicking on the timeline above the tracks
    defines some other kind of region, I'm guessing loop regions.
*** I assume: Start "recording" before the regions.
    The recording will only happen in it.
** using empty events to define multiple punch-in regions
*** ref
    Recording with Empty Events
    in the manual
*** procedure
    serial
**** Choose Options / Record mode: Auto-punch selected items
**** To make an empty event
     Highlight a region on the track and choose
     Insert / Empty item
**** Ctrl-click to select some events.
**** Each selected event now defines a punch-in / punch-out region.
