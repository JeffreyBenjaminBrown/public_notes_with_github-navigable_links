#+title: fast MIDI channel manipulations in Reaper

* some channel operations, with keyboard shortcuts

** (buggy) : "show only channel" X = Shift + (X:int)
   By default only defined for ten of the 16 channels.
   There's also "show all channels", which is the (~) character (i.e. S-`).

** increment channel = "set channel lower/higher" : JBB C-S-M-[+-]

   (that is, every modifier and + or -)
** "set channel for new events to X" : JBB C-S-M-(X:int)
   This has the effect of "draw on channel X",
   plus maybe other effects I'm not seeing.
* would also be nice : filter view to multiple but not all channels
  This is possible from the Filter menu,
  but not from the keyboard.
