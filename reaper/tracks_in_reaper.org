** "Free Item Positioning" (FIPM) enables it.
*** I think it's to let the user drag items vertically within a track.

* track mix (controls and view)
** the Route button
   controls where it goes.
   controls the volume at which it goes there.
** configurable: [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/reaper/track_and_time_window_views_in_reaper.org#configurable--whether-track-metering-is-pre--or-post-fader][whether track "metering" is pre- or post-fader]]
** Alt-solo will silence the soloed track's sends.
   The alternative is "solo in place", where sends are heard too.
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/reaper/nudge_reaper.org#multiple-kinds-of-things-can-be-nudged][Track volume, pan, and maybe more can be nudged.]]
* adjust many tracks at once
  Ctrl-click each relevant track control panel,
  then adjust any to adjust all.
** PITFALL: toggles (at least record-arm) in a group will stay out of sync
   If two tracks are selected,
   and one of them is armed and the other not,
   toggling their, uh, armament will toggle both,
   so it will still be the case that one is armed and the other not.
