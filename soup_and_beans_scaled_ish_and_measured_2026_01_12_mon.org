#+title: soup and beans, scaled-ish and measured, <2026-01-12 Mon>
* how I would change it
** less soup relative to beans
   try 1:1 rather than current 3:1
** more salt
   try 60 ml (30 in soup, 30 in beans)
   rather than 45 ml
* soup and beans, scaled-ish and measured, <2026-01-12 Mon>
** soup

   I made the soup Sunday and the beans Monday night, and ate some of the soup before making the beans, so let's say 4.5 kg soup to 1.5 kg beans, both born Monday night.
