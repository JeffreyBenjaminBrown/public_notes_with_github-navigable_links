      This indicates that Rust should treat any org-children that look like content as content,
      but should not delete the node's contains relationship to anything that doesn't appear as an org-child.

******* it's nice to write
        If S is not a containment root,
        the reason S links to T can often be clarified
        by including a link recursively contained in S

***** "Read the last branch last {it's the point, these are about it}."
      The most natural way to structure this would be
      the node saying that is talking about its children,
      not its brothers.
      That most ensures the reader reads it completely
      before processing the others.
      In this sense there might be nothing unnatural
      about a (sub)tree of many singleton branches.

******* How the query results are saved

        (in its text or content) that can be saved normally.

***** it vs. that
****** in a nutshell
       "It" refers to the container of the (containerward-)nearest container that used the word "that", or else the farthest container if none have said "that" (some others may have said "it").
****** more verbose
******* "that" can be used to change the subject to a nearer ancestor.
        After which point it would be referred to as "it",
        enabling further changes of subject.
******* example use case
        You might list a topic, within the topic ("it") a caveat,
        and within the caveat's contents refer to the caveat as "that".
****** if in doubt, just use an explicit hyperlink
***** Make comments about the meaning of a pair of braces.
***** Use a (hyperlink to a) relationship in a sentence.
***** Extract the punctuation I tend toward automatically.
      e.g. start with & and two words,
      using (path to) parent if absent

      I would use "[it] is an aspect of | illuminates [child]"
      and then ask Skg to show coverings.
      For instance, could use a small set of values
      to cover (probably not necessarily) the other values.
      'everything.org' does something like this already,
      but it is a tree -- a certain small set of values
      having been elevated (toward the root of the tree)
      as more fundamental than those they lens onto,
      when other sets could surely do likewise.

They get their view onto my data, and can show it to others. They can't delete things, and when they rename something its original title becomes an alias, but they can create name clashes to try to bury it.

    We waste so much information. So many have found the answer to what ails you, maybe always. We could choose our deepest guides, people claiming or linking to ideas, on a per-topic basis.

*** technical motivations
**** {Org} files are too far apart.
     Transitions between files are too stark.
     A person should choose the structure of how their attention forks,
     easily maintain two contexts in view at once.
**** if recording a relationship did not necessarily warp the view
     In a tree, it must.
***** example : It's hard to include "human" in my tree.
      I really want it to be a tag that doesn't interfere with the tree.

* guess I don't need right now
  to be able to undo an override
* leading whitespace
** to translate org to skg
   Subtract the minimum amount of whitespace from all nodes.
   if every line starts an equal number of spaces in,
   eliminate it all.
** to display it
   changing headline indentation should not move the body text.
   If the user wants to see the body text indented under the headline,
   there is an Emacs mode to superimpose that already.

** Avoid complex data structures in Emacs.
   Emacs seems best for buffer text.
   That text's properties can encode anything I need.
   All other logic, including types, should be in Rust.
   These allow one website to comment on another,
     such that subscribed readers
     can see those annotations from their target.
