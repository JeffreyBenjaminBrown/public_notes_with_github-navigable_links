** untapped meaning in my org notes
*** idea
   In a 3-node chain of descents, which is the middle word?
   When viewing an intermediating term from its own perspective,
   have a distinct branch called "intermediations".
   Each intermediation has two children:
   ```
     * intermediator
       [syntax $of the intermediator]
     ** [a role from that syntax]
     ** [the other role from that syntax]
   ```
   and the descendency order exists at least descending from a.
   If it exists descending from b as well,
   a herald should indicate that.
*** problem
*** asymmetry
    Perhaps no single relation is sufficient,
    because the relation used from b's perspective relating it to a
    is not the one used from a to relate it to b.
*** intermediator not always intermediating
    What if a member exists between the three,
    where the intermediator is not between the other two,
    but rather one of the other two?

** PITFALL | REMEMBER : Avoid complex data structures in Emacs.
   Emacs seems best for buffer text.
   That text's properties can encode anything I need.

**** it vs. that
***** in a nutshell
      "It" refers to the container of the (containerward-)nearest container that used the word "that", or else the farthest container if none have said "that" (some others may have said "it").
***** more verbose
****** "that" can be used to change the subject to a nearer ancestor.
       After which point it would be referred to as "it",
       enabling further changes of subject.
****** example use case
       You might list a topic, within the topic ("it") a caveat,
       and within the caveat's contents refer to the caveat as "that".
***** if in doubt, just use an explicit hyperlink
**** Make comments about the meaning of a pair of braces.
**** Use a (hyperlink to a) relationship in a sentence.
**** Extract the punctuation I tend toward automatically.
     e.g. start with & and two words,
     using (path to) parent if absent
*** share order across contexts
    An "order" (priority to reader) property makes sense common to the same nodes in different contexts.
    Esp. if they are common rel nodes like "instances".

*** nested links -- links in titles
**** the idea
     This is like creating a single-use relation type.
     Just like relatinoships with permanent types,
     this is useful because it automatically creates links
     to the items referenced in the title,
     rather than requiring the user to do that.

***** problem: It might be confusing that brackets are also used to indicate member types in [[:id:cfa775eb-9107-430a-a32c-228901d0f494][relation type definitions -- broken link?]].
**** search over titles that include links

     show them, rather than showing the whole title as one link.

*** public privacy and private privacy
    The user can insert a link to a private file anywhere, and the link might be public or not. When not, it is instead part of a corresponding file in their private repository, which refers to the public repository context that it modifies.ost.
** Half Baked Digital offered to share Skg.

** evangelism
*** If you feel special and want more you should want skg.
    read as a whole; the last is conclusion
**** Do yuo feel smarter than others?
**** Do you believe you could write
     down a good fraction of the ideas responsible for the difference?
**** Do you believe if others did it could make you far more powerful?
*** Just show mindmapping working. Youtube.
** Share Skg to everyone who uses those tools.
   TypeDB, Rust, Emacs
** fun-looking screenshots of mindmapping

    No need to look at diffs to think about sharing.
*** Child content stored separately from child position.
*** Subscriptions can be public and private.
*** Unsubscriptions could I think be public and private.
    The trick: In a public context the privately unsubscribed-from nodes should not show up.
*** Public subscriptions to private nodes reveal almost nothing.
    They reveal the fact of their existence,
    but not what they unsubscribe to -- not even its repo.
