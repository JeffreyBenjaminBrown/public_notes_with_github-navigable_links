#+title: org-roam usage
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/link_to_a_header_org_roam.org][link to a header \ org-roam]]
* to rename a file in org-roam
  [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/emacs/dired_emacs_package.org#to-rename-andor-move-across-folders-a-file-in-dired][Use dired to rename it]].
* to open something in the backlink buffer in the other window
  C-u RET
* to fold/unfold all the backlinks in the org-roam buffer
  C-TAB
  That's a standard magit-section command. The org-roam (backlink) buffer relies on magit-section.
  I don't know why there are a few lines of whitespace under each backlink, but this makes them go away.
* to rebuild the cache
  M-x -db-s
* link descriptions are automatically refactored
** maybe only in a newer version than the one I use?
** this can be disabled:

* a backlink is not visible until saved
that is, by saving the file that contains the backlink,
after creating the backlink
* to use a weird symbol (e.g. '\' or ',') in an alias
  Enclose the whole tag in parens.
  Write '\' as \\.
