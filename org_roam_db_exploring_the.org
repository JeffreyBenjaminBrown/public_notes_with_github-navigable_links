** In `nodes`, `pos`
   is the first character of the line.
** In `links`, `pos`
   is the first character of the link.
   It is relative to the file containing the link.
** Headlines with IDs are not considered linked to from the containing file with an ID.
   This makes sense -- it means `links` really tracks only links,
   which you can jump like hypertext,
   and not org-mode containment.
** To get the real text of a node, including links, find the ITEM property in the `proerties` column of `nodes`.
** Links anywhere in the subtree below a node call that node the source
   but the `pos` is still relative to the file containing the node.
* to view it
** from Bash
   evaluate `sqlite3 org-roam.db` in bash
** from Emacs
*** Evaluate my code at
    ~/hodal/osc-gen/main.el
*** then run a query like [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/org_roam_db_exploring_the.org#some-queries][one of these]]

** five things
   (org-roam-db-query-to-buffer
     [:select [id title file properties] :from nodes :limit 5])
** view a non-title node, internal to a file
      (org-roam-db-query-to-buffer
	 [:select [id title file level pos todo priority scheduled deadline properties olp]
          :from nodes
	 :where (= id "e663a892-7596-49c4-8b2e-d9fd9efb6cb2")])
** view a title node
      (org-roam-db-query-to-buffer
	 [:select [id title file level pos todo priority scheduled deadline properties olp]
          :from nodes
	 :where (= id "ef673990-4aa1-466f-ac5f-f0296b02e716")])
** some links
   (org-roam-db-query-to-buffer
     [:select [pos source dest type properties]
      :from links :limit 5])
** some files
   (org-roam-db-query-to-buffer
     [:select [file title hash atime mtime]
      :from files :limit 5])
* PITFALL: some text fields strip links of their ids and brackets
** the idea
   If a headline's text includes a link, it is stripped of its id and brackets. At least in some cases (e.g. the `nodes` table) it can be recovered elsewhere.
** example from `nodes` table
   This appears in the `properties` field:
   ((CATEGORY . health_personal_project)
    (ID . e663a892-7596-49c4-8b2e-d9fd9efb6cb2)
    (BLOCKED . )
    (FILE . /home/jeff/org-roam/personal/health_personal_project.org)
    (PRIORITY . B)
    (ITEM . see [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/org_personal-most_with-github-navigable_links/blob/master/dra_mejive_majjul_neurologo.org][dermatologist]] about itchy spot on arm))
   But that ITEM property appears to usually be absent -- because, I imagine, you can usually retrieve it from the title.
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/schemas_of_the_org_roam_db_tables.org#schema-links][The `properties` field in the `links` table does this too.]]
   And I'm not sure how to recover the links in that case.
