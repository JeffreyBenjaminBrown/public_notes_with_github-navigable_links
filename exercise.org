   Do otherwise and the back toe (or worse, heel)
   could catch on a stair, and I would fall backward,
   with weights in my hands.

** Clean first, because it *is* exercise.

* fun, useful : variations on hanging upside down
  e.g.
** DANGER: Don't fall on head.
** hanging from hands and knees
   and then maybe pulling up until head can rest,
   like it was a pillow, on the same bar the hands are holding
** hanging from knees with hands on the ground
   and then maybe doing handstand pushups
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/weight.org][weight]]
* reps to do
  The optimum depends on the exercise.
** Heavy compounds (deadlift, row, press): 6–10 reps.
** Bodyweight pulling (pull-ups): up to 12 reps.
** Leg balance work (lunges, Cossacks): 8–12 reps.
** Shoulder isolations (flies, rotator cuff): 12–20 reps.
* some exercises, by area
** cosmetic, safe to skip
*** shrugs
*** lateral raises
    standing upright, lifting weights from hips outward
    until the body forms a T
** legs
*** squats
*** cossacks
*** hip thrusts
    face up, neck and arms on couch, feet on floor,
    lift hips from floor, squeezing glutes at top
*** skater jumps | lateral bounds
*** some videos of some routines, no equipment needed

** back
*** Bent over reverse flies
**** Which also gets the shoulders
*** deadlifts
*** rows, inverted if I can
** chest
*** deficit pushups
    With the hands on plates, so that you can go down further.
    A bar won't work for that.
*** surplus pushups
    The opposite of deficit push-ups, where the feet are elevated.
    I invented the name.
*** archer pushups
    Going back and forth between one hand and the other.
*** Deficit and surplus pushups render ordinary ones redundant.
** shoulders
*** overhead press
*** bent over reverse flies

    Also gets back.
    One-handed if lower-back needs the support.
*** bent over rotator cuff extensions
