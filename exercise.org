** back
*** Bent over reverse flies
**** Which also gets the shoulders
*** deadlifts
*** rows, inverted if I can
** chest
*** deficit pushups
    With the hands on plates, so that you can go down further.
    A bar won't work for that.
*** surplus pushups
    The opposite of deficit push-ups, where the feet are elevated.
    I invented the name.
*** archer pushups
    Going back and forth between one hand and the other.
*** Deficit and surplus pushups render ordinary ones redundant.
** shoulders
*** overhead press
*** bent over reverse flies
