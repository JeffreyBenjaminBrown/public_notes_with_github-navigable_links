#+title: Linux: distributions, desktop environments, window managers
* PITFALL: Distro > Desktop Environment > Window Manager
* Linux distros
** Tiny Core might be the smallest.
   It's hard to use but it's the fastest, running entirely in RAM.
   Not part of NixOS.
** Puppy Linux is so small it can be run off a USB stick.
** other extremely lightweight distros
   Linux Lite -- not on NixOS
   antiX
* Linux desktop environments
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/kde.org][KDE]] is the cadillac.
   But it's not text-configurable,
   and the Settings GUI takes me about an hour of work each time I install.
** Gnome is text-configurable.
** lxqt seems to be the lightest mainstream desktop environment.
   services.xserver.desktopManager.lxqt.enable
** [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/xfce_desktop_environment.org][Xfce]] and Mate are the second-lightest mainstream desktop environments.
   They're about equally lightweight.
*** xfce is part of Xubuntu and other distros.
* Linux window managers
