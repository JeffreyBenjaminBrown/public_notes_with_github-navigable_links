#+title: <2026-01-26 Mon> feeling bleak about global power
In a capitalist system, private wealth is the one kind of hard (in a sense -- see below) power that the government does not control. Even capitalist democracies are fragile; communism has so far always coincided with autocracy.

If a few people control all the AI, power will become, similarly, much more centralized. With robot soldiers the government won't even have to keep the army happy, let alone the voting public.

There will still be a softer power in art, love, religion, games -- assuming there is freedom. But that freedom will depend on the mercies of a tiny elite.
