#+title: Circles of publication intimacy could protect people from cancellation.
* the idea
  Your (casual, Twitter-like) publications would be on a timer. First they go out to the people you trust to read what you write in good faith. If one of them sees you writing, e.g., a joke that could sink your career, they could tell you about it.
  If reading history is public, the publication conditions could be made yet more precise: "Don't share this to the wider public until at least five of my inner circle have read it, and a day has passed without anyone telling me it's a dumb idea."
