***** under-utilization
      The feasible challenges are too easy.

*** technical
**** At least one study seems to conflate cause and effect when purporting to find negative effects of boredom.
***** the study
      https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200001)56:1%3C149::AID-JCLP14%3E3.0.CO;2-Y
***** my critique
      They measured students with the Boredom Proneness Scale,
      at least some of the questions of which measure outcomes
      ("requently, when I am working, I find myself worrying
        about other things.")
      not predispositions.
***** caveats
      Some causality probably flows in both directions,
      and there are probably other influences too.
* As a child I wish my [tolerance for boredom in | willingness to complain about] class had been lower.
  I would have whined and pleaded until they advanced me.
