#+title: parquet (file format)
* pros and cons
** advantages, from Wikipedia
*** Column-wise compression is efficient in storage space
*** Encoding and compression techniques specific to the type of data in each column can be used
*** Queries that fetch specific column values need not read the entire row, thus improving performance
** disadvantage: not human-readable
** "The industry standard" for compressed tabular data.

* a less efficient but human-readable alternative
  Just keep a folder for each table,
  with a file for each column.
  Each such file has two columns:
  an index (ideally in [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/base64url.org][base64url]]),
  and the data of interest.
