#+title: why to maybe stop at the 15-limit
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/harmonic_23_is_not_worth_it.org][Harmonic 23 is not worth it.]]
* By similar logic, the 19th and 17th aren't worth it.
* By contrast, harmonic 15 is a full 16.5c from the nearest 13-limit ratio,
  and in the full 15-limit,
  no two ratios appear to be nearer than 10 cents to each other.
