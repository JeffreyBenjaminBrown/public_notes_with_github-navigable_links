#+title: kbd regions x timbre x sustain
* DONE equipment needed
  keith mcmillan footpedals + lumatone
* what the feet do
** selective sustain
** split timbre over keyboard, time
** octave shift per split
* an example of how to use it
  Define three (register,timbre) pairs,
  one for the bass region and two for treble.
  One of the two high registers is sustainable,
  s.t. feet can
    open and close the gate into sustain,
    clear the sustain,
    load the (current or last) sustained sound
      into to a button,
    retrigger it from there
