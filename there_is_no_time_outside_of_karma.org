   You might have a simple economic story for why someone did something {selfish, stupid, malevolent}. Their "higher self", meanwhile, chose those actions benevolently for you, bearing in mind its inifinitely complex ramifications -- who you would meet, what concepts and feelings you would encounter -- while making a face like "take that you little bastard".
*** Rebuttal: Wouldn't everyone?
    If it were possible, would it focus at a particular kind of person?
** karma > [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/justice.org][justice]]
   There can be (always, one hopes) karma where no justice.
   The way it feels, to who, and the strange resulting inequality,
   the biggest winners having the hollowest existences,
   those with the fullest often not recognizing it,
   the search for a just accounting demanding an unreasonable persistence of inter-character masses.
** Rather than redistributive justice, compositional.
*** elaboration
    Justice being something one recognizes, rather than achieving --
    each being's conditions somehow an outgrowth of its nature.
*** counterargument
    Potentially harmful idea,
    both for its quietist (de-motivating) implications,
    and for justifying injustice.
** There would be nothing but karma: Ways of sharing time.
   ways that are just
*** the world that would need to be to share their greatest dreams

* Karma might be humbling.
  That is, one's own karma might not be
  more important to understand than anyone else's.
* "You don't get to advance if you don't see what's happening."
* Our trials : How different, and how similar, are they?
