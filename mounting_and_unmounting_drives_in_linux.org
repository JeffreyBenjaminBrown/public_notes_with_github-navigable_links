** mount
   This mounts the device "sdb1",
   making it available at the "media" folder.

   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media
** unmount
   umount /path/where/device/is/mounted
   After this the device will still be visible in /dev,
   but not manipulable at the above long path.
* mount|unmount a drive via a GUI
  Use [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/gnome_disk_utility_application.org][gnome-disk-utility]].
* SOLUTION : to find out what processes are stopping `umount`
** alternatives
   I had better luck with `lsof`.
*** lsof           /path/to/folder/to/unmount
*** sudo fuser -vm /path/to/folder/to/unmount
** tags
   "error unmounting" "target is busy"
