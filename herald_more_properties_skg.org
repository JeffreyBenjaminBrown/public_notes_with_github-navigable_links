#+title: herald more properties \ skg
* DONE first
** whether contains parent
** whether parent contains it
** number of containers
** number of content
** number of links in
* heralds for links
** Whether a link uses an alternate title.
* There should be only one '{'
  With an integer befor eit, omitted if unity and present,
  and an integer after it counting its contents, omitted if 0.
  Only if both are absent is the '{' absent.
* truncation and folding
** the difference
*** 'folded': emacs org-mode folding
*** 'truncated': whether a node's contents are among its children
    If a node is truncated, it should be indefinitive.
** unicode symbols
*** truncated ? leading ellipsis
*** folded ? trailing ellipsis
* 3{ or 3{↻ as shape of containerward manifold

  A single scalar for
        the maximum {length, number of forks} in the path
    and whehther the path cycles.
  If its container is its unique org-parent,
    no glyph shown.
* generalize heralding number of containers to shape of containerward path
** n|m{ for "contained in a length-m chain of containers that leads to a n-pronged fork"
** o|n{ for a length-n chain that cycles
   the o is literally that letter, not a numeric variable
** <|n{ for a length-n chain that terminates at a root
* count links into a node's recursive contents

* the None herald: ≁ ~ ("not-tilde")
* [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/show_number_and_kind_of_upstream_nodes.org][show number and kind of upstream nodes]]
** [[:id:ac671944-2cb9-41b0-abbc-43dfe8a5377b][the number of containers, omitted if 1 -- broken link?]]
* visitation stats
  How many times in the last week, year, ever.
  How many days since last visited.
* A general symbol for metadata?
  a wavy equals
* later
** Herald that caveats exist.
** show how many [children] it has in a [neighboring branch]
*** the idea
    * experiences
    ** sacrifice
    ** thinking about something completely different
    ** being damaged by someone else's assumption
    ** a completely left-field idea that pays off spectacularly
    * encourage
    ** humility
    ** optimism
       # here I would like to be able to show a 1 count, for the child of "experiences" that starts "a completely left-field ..."
